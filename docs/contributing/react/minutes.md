Present: Ali, Alex, Tom, Sharlu

### Syllabus corrections

- Create a PR for any small typos/invalid link corrections, no need to create a ticket
- If links are invalid due to permission issues, reach out to Global Syllabus team for help
- For more 'controversial' tickets (e.g. #345), no need to wait to discuss in a meeting, create a PR and discuss async in comments

### Style Guides

- The syllabus contains some strong opinions around styling, would a specific style guide help to be clear around style?
  - A 'CYF [style guide](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/blob/master/docs/guides/code-style-guide.md) exists but is not React specific
  - Sticking to a strict style guide can be confusing; trainees will find 'unstyled' code online which can be confusing
  - Using Prettier in JS projects in a good standard

### Meeting the Global Syllabus team

- Ali suggested to meet the global syllabus team during one of the bi-weekly Thursday meetings to find out what they do and how they work

### Updating React module syllabus team meeting

- Time changed to 19:30 (GMT+1)

### Actions

- All: complete reading syllabus and coursework
- Tom: create PR to correct typos/dead links
- Sharlu: create ticket to add optional testing module (done: #478)
- Ali: ask Global Syllabus team about adding testing to other modules
- Ali: update meeting invite to new time (19:30)
- Alex: convert lessons into a single .md file to find 'splitting points'
- All: discuss sync/async suitable 'splitting points' in the 3 week course for updating to a 4 week course (#468)

### The board

- https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/projects/10?fullscreen=true
- Use this to plan and track our work (kanban-style)
- Feel free to open tickets if there is work that you would like to do
- Monthly planning: move tickets to the Todo column if someone is going to pick up the ticket in the next month

### Expanding the Hotel coursework

- Problem
  - The Hotel homework only takes a hour or 2 a week to complete, it could be expanded to have some more exercises
  - Exercises cover most or all of the content covered in the lesson - but need more practice of those concepts
  - Strong trainees could do with some more stretch goals - those that challenge them to extend knowledge of the concepts
- We have a very good set of alternative "challenge" projects that are part of the coursework
  - However, these are (intentionally) not very "prescriptive", unlike the Hotel coursework
  - But would still like to keep because trainees gain experience of setting up different React projects, and different problems to solve

### Actions

- Everyone: get familiar with the React module in it's current state
- Tom: write up ticket for splitting content over 4 weeks
- Ali: write up ticket for expanding coursework
- Alex: write up ticket for improving teaching of the concept of state
