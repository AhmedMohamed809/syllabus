Present: Ali, Alex, Tom, Sharlu, Zach

### The board

- https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/projects/10?fullscreen=true
- Use this to plan and track our work (kanban-style)
- Feel free to open tickets if there is work that you would like to do
- Monthly planning: move tickets to the Todo column if someone is going to pick up the ticket in the next month

### Expanding the Hotel coursework

- Problem
  - The Hotel homework only takes a hour or 2 a week to complete, it could be expanded to have some more exercises
  - Exercises cover most or all of the content covered in the lesson - but need more practice of those concepts
  - Strong trainees could do with some more stretch goals - those that challenge them to extend knowledge of the concepts
- We have a very good set of alternative "challenge" projects that are part of the coursework
  - However, these are (intentionally) not very "prescriptive", unlike the Hotel coursework
  - But would still like to keep because trainees gain experience of setting up different React projects, and different problems to solve

### Actions

- Everyone: get familiar with the React module in it's current state
- Tom: write up ticket for splitting content over 4 weeks
- Ali: write up ticket for expanding coursework
- Alex: write up ticket for improving teaching of the concept of state
