## 1) Module Delivery

This module is unusual as it follows an irregular delivery pattern

- Lesson 1 - Delivered on the second week of the full stack course
- Lesson 2 - Assigned as Coursework after JavaScript Core 1 Week 3
- Lesson 3 - Assigned as Coursework after JavaScript Core 2 Week 1
- Lesson 4 - Assigned as Coursework after JavaScript Core 2 Week 3

The content has been written to be delivered in this specific way to make the best use of Trainee's time through the course.

## 2) Preparation

This module has some preparation work that should be set as coursework before the module starts

You can find the preparation work [here](./preparation)
