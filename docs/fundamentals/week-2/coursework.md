## Using an IDE

We will use an IDE to write our code during Fundamentals, just like professional programmers. We use VSCode, and you should already have installed it during your course preparation. Here's a reminder of the tutorial you were given:

**&rarr; [Visual Studio Code](https://www.codecademy.com/article/visual-studio-code)**

### Refresh your understanding of paths

Read this lesson on file paths and folders: [Using paths & folders](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/paths-folders/) and save the [cheatsheet](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/naming-paths-cheat-sheet/) to help you.

## CYF Blocks (8h)

Complete the [CYF Blocks](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/#introduction) Syllabus, including at least 6 "projects". Write down any questions you have to ask when we next meet.

Share at least two of your completed projects in google classrooms. Share your favourite project (or something completely new) in the Slack channel for your cohort.
