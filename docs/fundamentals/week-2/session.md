## Welcome

Welcome to week two! In week two we will explore iteration. Iteration means to repeat. Developers do many small iterations to build software, each time adding or changing some small thing. This is why your phone is always updating: each new version is an iteration. If developers waited until software was perfectly ‘finished’, it would never be delivered.

## Blockers! (60 minutes)

[Online Version of this game](https://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/online-traffic-jam-game.html)

#### **Objectives**

- Share your screen
- Identify the blocker
- Use driver and navigator pattern
- Break down a problem into steps
- Negotiate a strategy with your team
- Follow directions

### Gameplay

:::note Exercise (30 minutes)
In groups or breakout rooms of 4 trainees maximum.

One person will share their screen and be the **driver**. The driver can only move the pieces where you are told by the navigators. The driver cannot make any decisions!

The others will be the **navigators**. Together, the navigators must figure out a strategy to unblock the car, and tell the driver how to do it!
:::

**Each person must drive,** so set a timer for [**5 minutes per round**](https://www.google.com/search?q=set+a+timer+for+5+minutes) and then swap.

:::tip
Mentors can only be passengers: no driving or navigating. Mentors may ask questions but not answer them. Mentors will make sure the driver and navigators are following their roles correctly.

### Reflection
