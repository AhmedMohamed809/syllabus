Welcome to week two! In week two we will explore iteration. Iteration means to repeat. Developers do many small iterations to build software, each time adding or changing some small thing. This is why your phone is always updating: each new version is an iteration. If developers waited until software was perfectly ‘finished’, it would never be delivered.

## Blockers! (60 minutes)

[Online Version of this game](https://www.dr-mikes-math-games-for-kids.com/online-traffic-jam-game.html)

#### **Objectives**

- Share your screen
- Identify the blocker
- Use driver and navigator pattern
- Break down a problem into steps
- Negotiate a strategy with your team
- Follow directions

### Gameplay

:::note Exercise (30 minutes)
In groups or breakout rooms of 4 trainees maximum.

One person will share their screen and be the **driver**. The driver can only move the pieces where you are told by the navigators. The driver cannot make any decisions!

The others will be the **navigators**. Together, the navigators must figure out a strategy to unblock the car, and tell the driver how to do it!
:::

**Each person must drive,** so set a timer for [**5 minutes per round**](https://www.google.com/search?q=set+a+timer+for+5+minutes) and then swap.

:::tip
Mentors can only be passengers: no driving or navigating. Mentors may ask questions but not answer them. Mentors will make sure the driver and navigators are following their roles correctly.
:::

### Reflection

Back in the main room.

:::note Exercise (20 minutes)
What did people think about this game? Let’s go around and each group share **one thing** they noticed about it.
:::

## Blockers (45 minutes)

:::note Exercise: 5 mins

Join the Jam board and add your blockers. Make sure to add only _one_ blocker per note.
:::

## MVP

### Recap - user stories

Last time we discussed **user stories**. Can you remember the structure of a typical user story?

:::tip User Story

As a _[who]_, I can _[what]_ so that _[why]_
:::

:::note Exercise: Favourite App (10 minutes)

Split into groups and think about one of your favourite phone apps. Agree on one you all know. Come up with as many user stories as you can for it. You must come up with at least 10, but try for more. Set a timer for 10 minutes and write them on a new [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/)
:::

### Defining the Minimum Viable Product

Come back into the main room, now we have a long list of user stories, how do we decide what to do first? Where do we start? As always with software development, we start with the simplest thing possible. Let’s define the **MVP**.

What's the _minimum_ set of user stories we could implement for this product to be useful? Another way to say this is: **"What is the minimum viable product?**

:::note Exercise: Prioritise! (10m)

1. Swap your [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) with another group.
2. Now go back into breakout rooms, with another group’s Jamboard of user stories
3. Set a timer for 10 minutes
4. Choose the stories that make up the MVP for that app
5. Are there any missing? Note them down

:::

Now come back into the main room.

## Capgemini

:::info Meet Capgemini (60m)
Our partners, Capgemini, will drop in and spend an hour with you.

## Iterating

### Pairing

It's good to code with a friend. You learn SO much. Programmers call this pair programming and many professional teams program in pairs for a part of each day. Mentors will demonstrate pairing now.

:::note Exercise: Pairing

In pairs, iteratively develop a solution to the CYF Blocks problem you are given.

- Switch between driver and navigator roles every 10 minutes
- The "driver" is the person typing on the keyboard, just thinking about what needs to be written
- The "navigator" reviews what the driver is doing and is thinking about to write next
- Don't dominate - this is teamwork

:::

### CYF Blocks

Now we have started to think about the idea of MVP, how can we use this to help us build _working_ software?

:::tip
It's important that software _works_ and that we can _use_ it!
:::

In software development, we start with the smallest, simplest thing we can build _that works_. Then we _incrementally_ improve it. This is **iteration**.

You all built a personal home page in Intro to Digital, and last week you shipped it. Now let's iterate on your websites.

:::note Exercise: Point (10m)

In pairs, define some user stories for your own websites, to improve it. These should be:

- a small change
- that is achievable with the CYF Blocks seen in the course so far
- but a complete feature
- try for at least one feature that updates or changes the page when an action is taken

:::

:::note Exercise: Click! (25m)
In the same pairs, try to implement one user story. While implementing, try to break down into steps where you can visually check that your code runs as expected.
:::

## Ship It

It's important to ship your work, so let's ship the new version of our websites. You know what to do!

:::note Exercise

Ship it!
:::

## Retro

We will do a 15 minute retro together.

## Coursework

Find the coursework for this week on the [coursework](./coursework) page.

## Feedback

Please spend two minutes reviewing this lesson to help us improve it for the future. This feedback will be shared with volunteers.
