Concrete graduation criteria here

You absolutely must have a firm plan to be working in software development this time next year. If your plan is to go to university, or do something else, _go and do that first_ . And then come back to us when you are ready to become a developer. You will always be welcome at CYF. But this is a vocational training programme that can only offer you _real vocational skills_, not credentials you can store up.

Development is a very fast moving industry and the tech we teach now could well be obsolete in three years time. Tech does not work like other professions, your experience must be recent to be valuable. So be ready to make the change _now_.

If you don't plan to take a job, you affect the success rate statistics for the whole programme. Of course things happen, life changes, there's always room at CYF for that, but please seriously consider now what your real plans are.
