## Welcome!

Welcome to week three! In week three we will explore delivery. Delivery is the catch-all term for shipping your code, or putting it in online, in a public place where real people can use it. This ability is key to being a successful professional developer.

## Coursework review (45 minutes)

We always begin our day with live coding and group debugging using trainees' work as material. This session is an opportunity to work through common problems with coursework and also to demonstrate productive code review and debugging strategies. Use Devtools where possible and live code.

## Shipping it

Why is shipping code important?

Today we will spend most of our time working together on our projects in timed bursts of 25 minutes. This is called the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), and it will help you manage your self study. On the 5 minute break, get up from your computer and move your body: stretch! This is hard work. We will develop and then ship our code repeatedly throughout the day.

How will you work together? Using the collaborative tools you have learned during this course:

## You are part of a cohort

- together: identify your blockers
- in small groups: define your goals as user stories
- in pairs: iteratively improve your products

## Wrap up

### Reflection on Fundamentals

We have worked together over these weeks exploring some of what it means to be a software developer. If you have [met the criteria](./graduation/criteria) you will now be invited to join the Software Development Course. Let's think together about what software developers really do.

:::info Exercise: 5 mins

Join the Jam board and add your ideas. Make sure to add only _one_ idea per note.

Mentors will now lead a reflection and then we will do our last retro!
