## CYF Blocks (8h)

Pick one or more of the following projects, define its requirements by writing the user stories, iteratively develop it in [CYF Blocks](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/), and ship it!

- Commenting: Make it possible for a user to add a comment on your website (the comment won't get saved anywhere, so it will disappear when the page is refreshed - we'll work on saving later on)
- Shopping Cart Light: Make it possible to add products to a "shopping cart" (again, we won't be able to check out/pay with what we know so far)
- Image carousel: Allow the user to cycle through a set of images
- Hamburger menu: Display a dropdown menu like https://dev.to/devggaurav/let-s-build-a-responsive-navbar-and-hamburger-menu-using-html-css-and-javascript-4gci

Share one of your projects in Google Classroom, not forgetting to include:

- Your user stories
- Your CYF Blocks implementation (using the share button)
- Your deployed website

Share your deployed website in your cohort's Slack channel.
