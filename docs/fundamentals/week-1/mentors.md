# Requirements

## Schedule

Here's a rough schedule, which you can adapt to suit your cohort. You should also schedule at least one short break in the afternoon for prayers. Parcel out the sessions between volunteers in a planning call beforehand. Once you've planned it, make sure you share the schedule with all trainees and volunteers _at least 24 hours beforehand_, so they can make any necessary travel, childcare, religious, and other logistical arrangements.

## Telephone

Play the default game! You don’t need to explain what to do, people will figure it out. You might try playing it between the mentors before the session. It’s a fun icebreaker. Limit the groups to 5 or else the game takes too long. It takes **10 minutes** to play with **5 people**.

Now come back into the main room and lead a reflection.

:::tip Example reflection:

Was it surprising (and hilarious) to see what other people drew from your words? What about how they described your picture? Did anybody get a series of _similar_ pictures or words?
:::

## User Stories

### Sample reflection for mentor

:::tip Example reflection:
What’s NOT in the user story? (It’s the how.) One reason to write user stories is to establish clearly what we are doing and why. A common mistake in coding is jumping straight into “how” before we understand and agree these things. This wastes a lot of time. If you find yourself jumping straight to “how” or “jumping to conclusions”, check yourself! Remember the telephone game and how absurdly wrong things can go.

## Coursework review

## Shout Out Questions

At the beginning of the lesson, get the students thinking about questions that they had during the week. To avoid getting distracted with answering a question for too long, run a short session where you write down all the questions on a whiteboard.

You can then prioritise answering the questions on your own time, or split into groups to answer several questions at once.

It is also useful to get a volunteer write up the questions in a more permanent place \(e.g. [as a Gist](https://gist.github.com/)\) and share on Slack.

## Coursework In Perspective

Quick presentation to discuss how block-based programming is relevant in the "real world", as it can appear a little "childish" to adults.

Sequence, repetition with loops, conditional execution with if/else, and breaking bigger problems into smaller problems, with functions.

Possibly showing representations in JS, by clicking the "Show code" button on Code.org.

## Start coursework in class

It is a good idea to spend some time in the class working through the interfaces and the first few challenges.

## Assigning Coursework

At the end of Class, assign the homework for this week through Google Classroom.
