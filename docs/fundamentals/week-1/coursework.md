## HTML-CSS refresh (4 hours)

During Fundamentals, we will be building a website with a block-based programming tool called CYF Blocks. The underlying code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you have not done so already, prepare yourself now with this free crash course, to refresh and consolidate your learning from Intro to Digital.

**&rarr; [HTML CSS Crash Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlcss)**

## Code.org

Code.org is a website which teaches beginners how to code and gives them lots of practice.
It uses block-based coding. Don't be put off by the simplicity - top universities teach block-based coding (e.g. Berkeley & Harvard).

Over the next few weeks, we will be completing the course called "Course 3", but this week you only need to do up to Lesson 12, _Farmer: While Loops_. It's important to spend some time with these ideas to prepare yourself for CYF Blocks.

To get set up:

- Use the account you made during your class preparation.
- Start by clicking on item 1 from lesson "2. Maze". (Yes, you should skip lesson 1). Let the instructors know if you get stuck - it is easiest for us to help you during class.

Read the instructions carefully and complete all stages of these lessons:

- Lesson 2 - Maze
- Lesson 3 - Artist
- Lesson 5 - Artist: Functions
- Lesson 6 - Bee: Functions
- Lesson 7 - Bee: Conditionals
- Lesson 8 - Maze: Conditionals
- Lesson 11 - Artist: Nested Loops
- Lesson 12 - Farmer: While Loops

**_Skip_** all of the lessons starting with "Unplugged Activity".

Once you're finished, press submit in Google Classroom, and please add a comment mentioning your Code.org username.

## CYF Blocks

In this course, you will use block-based programming to create JavaScript that changes the HTML on a web page. Work through the exercises in order and do as many as you feel able.

**You must complete at least the first two exercises before we next meet.** Come to the session with your questions and we will all discuss them together.

Write down some questions to bring up next week.
