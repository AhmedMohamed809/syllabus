## HTML-CSS refresh (4 hours)

During Fundamentals, we will be building a website with a block-based programming tool called CYF Blocks. The underlying code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you have not done so already, prepare yourself now with this free crash course, to refresh and consolidate your learning from Intro to Digital.

## Code.org

Code.org is a website which teaches beginners how to code and gives them lots of practice.
It uses block-based coding. Don't be put off by the simplicity - even top universities teach block-based coding (e.g. Berkeley & Harvard).

We will be completing the course called "Course 3".

To get set up, follow these instructions:

- Use the account you made during your class preparation.
- Start by clicking on item 1 from lesson "2. Maze". (Yes, you should skip lesson 1). Let the instructors know if you get stuck - it is easiest for us to help you during class.

Read the instructions carefully and try to complete all stages of ALL lessons EXCEPT the ones below.

**_Skip_** all of the lessons starting with these numbers: **1, 4, 9, 10, 18, 19, 20**

(All of the lessons starting with "Unplugged Activity")

Once you're finished, press submit in Google Classroom, and please add a comment mentioning your Code.org username.
