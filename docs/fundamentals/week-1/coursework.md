## HTML-CSS refresh (4 hours)

During Fundamentals, we will be building a website with a block-based programming tool called CYF Blocks. The underlying code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you have not done so already, prepare yourself now with this free crash course, to refresh and consolidate your learning from Intro to Digital.

**&rarr; [HTML CSS Crash Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlcss)**

## Code.org (4 hours)

Code.org is a website which teaches beginners how to code and gives them lots of practice.
It uses block-based coding. Don't be put off by the simplicity - top universities teach block-based coding (e.g. Berkeley & Harvard).

As we will be doing most of our coding in CYF blocks, you only need to do up to Lesson 12, _Farmer: While Loops_. It's important to spend some time with these ideas to prepare yourself for CYF Blocks.

To get set up:

- Use the account you made during your class preparation.
- Start by clicking on item 1 from lesson "2. Maze". (Yes, you should skip lesson 1). Let the instructors know if you get stuck - it is easiest for us to help you during class.

Read the instructions carefully and complete all stages of these lessons:

- Lesson 2 - Maze
- Lesson 3 - Artist
- Lesson 5 - Artist: Functions
- Lesson 6 - Bee: Functions
- Lesson 7 - Bee: Conditionals
- Lesson 8 - Maze: Conditionals
- Lesson 11 - Artist: Nested Loops
- Lesson 12 - Farmer: While Loops

**_Skip_** all of the lessons starting with "Unplugged Activity".

Once you're finished, press submit in Google Classroom, and please add a comment mentioning your Code.org username.

## CYF Blocks (6 hours)

In this course, you will use block-based programming ([CYF Blocks](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/)) to create JavaScript that changes the HTML on a web page. Work through the exercises in order up to [Buttons, inputs and clicks: a todo list](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/#exercise_todo_list).

**You must at least attempt all those exercises before we meet.**. If you get stuck, don't worry. Come to the session with your questions and we will all discuss them together.

Once you're finished, share your solution to [List of links](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/#exercise_list_links) in google classroom.

If you have extra time, complete one of the exercises in [Buttons and Clicks: consolidation](https://blocks.codeyourfuture.io/#exercise_button_consolidation) (or create something entirely new) and share it with your cohort in the Slack channel.

Write down some questions to bring up next week.
