Next lesson, we will be going back to learning about JavaScript.

Review what you've learnt so far to prepare yourself for the next lesson.

We recommend that you

- Complete some online courses to see what gaps you have in your knowledge you have
- Prepare any questions you have about basic JavaScript
- Have a call with other trainees to discuss anything you don't understand.

You should always read through the next lesson, in preparation for class. For JS-1 you need to complete this prep:
