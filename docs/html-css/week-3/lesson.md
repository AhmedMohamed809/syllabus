## HTML/CSS Frameworks

A design framework is a collection of re-usable code snippets which you can use to build a website. It is sometimes called a "design system", "style guide", or "pattern library", and will usually consist of three things:

1. **Brand guidelines** define the appropriate typography, colors and logos to use.
2. **Components** define re-usable code snippets for common requirements, like navigation menus.
3. **Helpers** define additional code tools to construct the site, like layout grids.

The main goals of a design framework are to ensure design consistency and avoid writing the same code twice.

## Bootstrap 4

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is CSS and JavaScript code that we [load in our HTML pages](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/). Bootstrap's documentation describes how to write HTML code that fits the Bootstrap components, including a [grid layout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) as well as several [components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/).

### Exercise (15 minutes)

Fork [this repository](https://github.com/NateWr/groupstrap) and follow the instructions in the [readme](https://github.com/NateWr/groupstrap) to create a new page and add a card component to it.

## Personal Website Project

Over the last two weeks, you've been building personal websites as part of your homework. Now we want you to take those websites and apply the knowledge you've learned to make them as good as you can. Some ideas:

- Add [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) to your site and use some of the components.
- Use re-usable class names to reduce your CSS code.
- [Validate your HTML code](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to find and fix problems.
- Add a second page and link to it from your first page.
- Try to style the first article differently so that it stands out from the rest.

By the end, you should have created a repository for your site on GitHub with all the commits you've made.

## Retrospective

At the end of each module, we'll have a retrospective. What went right? What went wrong? What can we do better to help you learn? Let's discuss the HTML/CSS module.
