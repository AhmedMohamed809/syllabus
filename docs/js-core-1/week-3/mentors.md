## Notes on truthy, falsy, null, and undefined

This session is only to establish some initial habits of thought, especially around debugging. This is such a tricky idea to grasp and so helpful to understand, so talk a little bit about different errors produced by these states.

Don't get too deep into the technicalities as trainees have not yet covered enough JS to grasp the implications (eg scope, state and initialisation). Instead, try to produce some common [Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) errors and [Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError) errors, particularly:

`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property of undefined`
`Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function`

and discuss them together. If you have time, connect this back to user input validation in HTML Forms. What happens when you write code that assumes a variable has a length, but the user doesn't set a name?

There's a small [Codewars collection](https://www.codewars.com/collections/cyf-handling-falsy) and you could work through a kata in class as a group.
