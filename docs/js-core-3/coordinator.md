## 1) Preparation

## 2) Assessment

After the final week of this module there are assessment that should be completed by all trainees.

These assessments should be conducted one-on-one with a volunteer (possibly the trainee's buddy). Each of the assessments has a rubric that should be followed. After completion, the trainees score should be shared with the City Coordinator

The aim of these assessments is to

- Work out how well each trainee is doing in the class
- Highlight trainees who are falling behind and require help
- Get oversight of any common misconceptions in the class
