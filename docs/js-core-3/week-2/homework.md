## 1) Review Solutions for Last Weeks Coursework

Before starting this week, be sure to review the solutions for last weeks coursework

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/JavaScript-Core-3-Coursework-Week1-Solution

Make sure you work out what you don't understand and spend some time considering how the code works.

In each of the folders you'll find a `solutions.md` file that will explain more of the solution to you. You should read each of them.

**Note**: This is a private repository. Please speak to your Teacher, Buddy or Class Coordinator to get access. You should ask them to invite your whole class.

## 1) Practice the concepts (1 hours)

This week's concepts can be challenging, therefore let's get an easy introduction using some interactive exercises! Check the following resources out and start practicing.

You can ignore anything to do with `XMLHttpRequest`

- FreeCodeCamp
  - https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-es6-guide-on-how-to-perform-http-requests-using-the-fetch-api-594c3d91a547/

## 2) Code along (1 hour)

Now that you've learned about APIs and how to connect with them, let's apply it in the context of a complete application.

In the following application you'll be watching somebody make an API call to an external, public API.

You are welcome to code along as you watch - this will help you to understand what exactly the presenter is doing.

Enjoy!
