You can find the exercises here:

https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/mongodb/week-1/lesson

## 2) Readwell Project (8 Hours)

Your job is to write some API endpoints in the Express server code to correctly return books from the MongoDB collection.

You can find the full description for this task here:

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/MongoDB-Coursework-Week1-2

You should complete all of the tasks in WEEK-1.md

## 3) Making Your Quote App Full Stack

You now know enough about MongoDB to make the Node apps that you made in the last module retrieve their data from a database.

For this coursework you should add MongoDB to your Quote Server homework so that all of the data is retrieved from the database instead of the `quotes.js` file in the repository.

You can find the project here:
https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/node-challenge-quote-server

You should continue with the same project that you made before.
